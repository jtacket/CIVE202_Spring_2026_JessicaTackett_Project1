This includes all the files for Project No.1

#The goal of this project is to analyze and summarize data from the AirPurple dataset to see if Nebraska’s air quality is meeting National Ambient Air Quality Standards, identifying where pollution hotspots are, how environmental factors contribute to air quality, and the potential health concerns. The data is collected from various locations across Nebraska, allowing UNMC to understand how air pollution affects human health. UNMC has requested five key analyses: (1) identifying the 5 locations in Nebraska with the highest mean and median measurements for concentrations of VOC, PM2.5, and PM 10.0, (2) dates where the maximums of the pollutants occurred and their potential causes, (3) analysis of whether humidity and temperature have an relation to air quality, (4) seeing  where and when there have been any Air Quality Index (AQI) health risks, with regard to measurements of PM 2.5 and PM 10.0, and seeing if there are any potential causes and finally, (5) whether the sensor altitude has an impact on the air quality values.
